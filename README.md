This repository contains a MATLAB function that demonstrates an uncommon error related to unhandled floating-point exceptions. The function works as expected for integer inputs, but it throws an error when provided with floating-point numbers due to the way the conditional statements are handled. The solution demonstrates how to correctly handle floating-point numbers to resolve this issue.
